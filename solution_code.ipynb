    "# Interconnect Telecom Operator: Predicting Churn\n",
    "In this project, the telecom operator Interconnect wants to be able to forecast their churn of clients. Clients that are identified as likely to leave can be offered promotional codes and special plan options. In order to predict customer churn, a machine learning binary classification model will be developed and tested using AUC-ROC and accuracy as metrics to evaluate the model. A threshold AUC-ROC score <u><</u>0.75 will be used to determine an adequate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps will be taken:\n",
    "1. Download libraries and data, combine data into a single data set, and address data anomalies.\n",
    "2. Conduct exploratory analysis, use feature engineering to create additional variables relevant for model training and testing.\n",
    "3. Prepare categorical variables for modeling (e.g., one hot encoding or label encoding depending on models).\n",
    "4. Test classification algorithms, tuning hyperparameters to improve AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics.\n",
    "5. Use gradient boosting (Light GBM) to determine whether it improves the quality of the model. Test CatBoost gradient boosting algorithm if threshold not achieved (min AUC-ROC 0.75).\n",
    "6. Summarize process results."

    "Libraries and data were loaded and initial review completed. The data sets (contract, personal, internet, and phone) were merged based on customer ID number. The following variables were changed from object data types to numeric (totalcharges) and datetime type (begindate). There were a small number of data points (n=11) with missing data in the contract data set which were determined to be from the last month where data was collected (i.e., only one month of charges); the missing data points were replaced with the monthly charges for that month for those observations. After merging data sets, there were customers without \"phone\" data (i.e., multiplelines variable NaN) and without \"internet\" data, which are customers that do not have phone or internet service as part of their plan. NaN were replaced with \"no_service\" for those observations in relevant column. There were no duplicate data and descriptive statistics showed no other major anomalies."

    "**Results and Conclusions**\n",
    "The merged data set (contract, personal, phone) was used for exploratory data analysis (EDA). Feature engineering was used to create two new variables: a) churn variable indicating whether a customer had closed their account (1) or not (0) that will be used as the target variable, and b) a variable (length_cust) that calculates the total number of days a customer has been active (either until they left or until the last point of data collection if still active). This can be used as a feature variable, dropping begindate and enddate to avoid data leakage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of customers have paperless billing (59%), month-to-month contracts (55%), are not senior citizens (84% not senior citizens), have no partner (52%), and have no dependents (70%). Gender was nearly evenly split (50% male, 50% female), as was the partner variable (52% no partner vs. 48% partner). Of four billing options, approx one-third (34%) pay by electronic check, with proportions nearly evenly split among the other three options (approx 22% for each).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was compared for individuals that had left or not (churn), the target variable, including total numbers, and comparisons for the two groups for other variables. Approx three-quarters of customers were still active in the data set (n=5163 or 73%), indicating a class imbalance that will be addressed in model development. \n",
    "\n",
    "Average monthly charges were higher for those that had left (74.44 vs. 61.31) while total charges were higher for active customers (2,555.34 vs. 1,531.80). Customers that had left had higher rates of paperless billing (75% vs. 54% active customers), more month-to-month contract types (89% for churned customers vs. 43% active), and paid more often by electronic check (57% churned customers vs. 25% active). Gender proportions were similar for customers that had left or not (50% female for those that had left vs. 49% active customers), while customers that had left were more likely to be older (25% senior citizens vs. 13%), less likely to have a partner (36% vs. 53%), and less likely to have dependents (17% vs. 34%). Active customers had a tenure of 1,146 days vs. 547 days for those that had left. Customers with phone plans vs. not were similar for active customers (10% without phone plans in their overall plan) and churned customers (9% without phone plans). By contrast, the proportion of customers without internet plans among active clients (27% no internet service) was higher than those that had churned (6% no internet service)."

    "## 3. Model Development and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are created that will be used with various models. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Light GBM (gradient boosting) models are developed, trained, and tuned with hyperparameters. Categorical vairables are transformed with one-hot encoding or label encoding as relevant. Class imbalances of the target variable are addressed through upsampling, downsampling, and balancing class weights within models as relevant. Thresholds to optimize metrics are also adjusted. AUC-ROC is the main metric to assess models, but accuracy is also measured. The best fit model is identified based on model development, hyperparameter tuning and metrics."

    "**Results and Conclusions**\n",
    "In this section, the following steps were taken to create a classification machine learning model:\n",
    "- Categorical feature variables were transformed using one-hot encoding (for Linear Regression) or label encoding (for Random Forest Classifier and Light GBM). Numeric feature variables were standardized.\n",
    "- Training, validation and test data sets were created, and features and target data identified. \n",
    "- Three models were developed, trained, and evaluated on validation data using AUC-ROC and accuracy scores. The three models were Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Light GBM.\n",
    "- Hyperparameters were tuned to strengthen the model, and class imbalances addressed through balancing class weights in models where relevant, as well as through upsampling and downsampling. Thresholds to maximize metrics were also identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The models performed as follows:\n",
    "- The Gradient Boosting model (Light GBM) performed the best with a final AUC-ROC Score of 0.831 for the validation data set and an accuracy score of 0.803. Gridsearch was used to tune the hyper parameters to identify the best fit model (number rounds=100, GBDT boosting, binary objective, colsample_bytree=0.8, max_depth=3, num_leaves=31, subsample=0.8).\n",
    "- The Logistic Regression model was the most poorly performing of the three models, with a final AUC-ROC Score of 0.744 for validation data (below the minimum required score), and an accuracy score 0.753. This model had a low level of overfitting as AUC-ROC for training data was 0.765 and accuracy for training data was also 0.765, similar in both cases to the validation scores. The best fit model for Logistic Regression used downsampled features (fraction=0.42), and a classification threshold (0.5).\n",
    "- The Random Forest Classification performed decently, with a validation data AUC-ROC Score of 0.757 just over the minimum required score of 0.75. The accuracy score for the final model on validation data was 0.717. There was some overfitting as the AUC-ROC score for training data was 0.803 and for accuracy was also 0.803. The final Random Forest Classification model (max_depth=6, n_estimators=20) was used with downsampled features (fraction=0.38) and a classification threshold (0.46).\n",
    "- The AUC-ROC scores were similar to the accuracy scores, with AUC-ROC slightly better for the Gradient Boosting model (difference of 0.028), and slightly worse for the Random Forest model (difference of 0.040). For the Gradient Boosting model, this suggests the model is stronger at assigning probabilities for the target classes, but not as accurate in predicting the actual class (churn vs. not). However, given the small difference, this is likely not a key concern. In addition. AUC-ROC is generally better for data with class imbalances, which the data for this project exhibits. \n"

    "The final model (Gradient Boosting, Light GBM, GBDT boosting, binary objective', colsample_bytree=0.8, max_depth=3, num_leaves=31, subsample=0.8) was trained on training data and tested with the test data set. The final metrics continued to perform well, with the final AUC-ROC Score at 0.842, above the minimum score of 0.75. Accuracy was similarly strong at 0.808. As such, the final selected model performed well with the final test data and is recommended as the model to be adopted by the company for identifying customers that may leave."

    "In this project, a machine learning binary classification model was developed to be able to forecast the churn of clients for the telecom operator Interconnect. This will be used to offer promotional codes and special plan options to clients identified as likely to leave. The models were tested using AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics. A threshold AUC-ROC score <u><</u>0.75 was used to determine an adequate model. The project aimed to address the following questions:\n",
    "- What data is appropriate to include in the models?\n",
    "- What algorithm results in the best quality predictions for customer churn?\n",
    "- What hyperparameter tuning will improve the quality of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps were taken:\n",
    "1. Downloaded libraries and data, combined data into a single data set, and addressed data anomalies.\n",
    "2. Conducted exploratory analysis, using feature engineering to create additional variables relevant for model training and testing. Comparisons between active and churned customers were explored.\n",
    "3. Prepared categorical variables for modeling (e.g., one hot encoding or label encoding depending on models). Numeric feature variables were standardized. Training, validation and test data sets were created, along with features and target data.\n",
    "4. Tested classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classification, Gradient Boosting - Light GBM), tuning hyperparameters to improve AUC-ROC and accuracy metrics. Class imbalances addressed through balancing class weights in models where relevant, as well as through upsampling and downsampling. Thresholds to maximize metrics were also identified.\n",
    "5. Used gradient boosting (Light GBM) to further improve the models. Gridsearch was used to tune the hyperparameters to identify the best fit model. \n",
    "6. Models were adjusted to reach the required AUC-ROC score minimum (<u><</u>0.75) for validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps above followed the initial plan, although some adjustments to the initial plan were made as follows:\n",
    "- Instead of dropping missing data for totalcharges (11 rows), further exploratory analysis was conducted that determined missing data points were from observations with only one month of data. The monthlycharges data were used for totalcharges for those observations.\n",
    "- LightGBM gradient boosting was tested and determined a good fit for the task and data. CatBoost was planned as an alternative if LightGBM did not perform well. Ultimately, it was determined that CatBoost did not need to be tested based on the results of LightGBM.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were no significant challenges to the project other than working through the various models and tuning hyperparameters to meet the required AUC-ROC score threshold. A number of steps were taken to test various strategies to improve model quality, including a) upsampling, downsampling and balancing class weights, b) hyperparameter tuning: max_depth and n_estimators for Random Forest and using gridsearch for the LightGBM gradient boosting model, and c) finding the best threshold to optimize the evaluation metric after running the model. Those steps were also the most important for solving the task and reaching the AUC-ROC score minimum of 0.75.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following results emerged:\n",
    "- Data types were adjusted as relevant (to numeric and datetime). Missing data was filled with appropriate values (monthly charges for customers with missing total charges indicating only one month of service), and \"no_service\" for customers with missing phone or internet service data (i.e., those customers did not sign up for those services). There were no duplicate data and descriptive statistics showed no other major anomalies.\n",
    "- The majority of customers have paperless billing (59%), month-to-month contracts (55%), are not senior citizens (84% not senior citizens), have no partner (52%), and have no dependents (70%). Gender was nearly evenly split (50% male, 50% female), as was the partner variable (52% no partner vs. 48% partner). Of four billing options, approx one-third (34%) pay by electronic check, with proportions nearly evenly split among the other three options (approx 22% for each).\n",
    "- Data was compared for individuals that had left or not (churn), the target variable, including total numbers, and comparisons for the two groups for other variables. Approx three-quarters of customers were still active in the data set (n=5163 or 73%), indicating a class imbalance that was addressed in model development. \n",
    "- There were differences between churn and active customers relating to average monthly charges, total charges, paperless billing, contract type, and payment type. There were also differences for age (senior citizen or not), partner, dependents, but gender proportions were similar for churn vs. active customers. Customers with phone plans vs. not were similar for active customers (10% without phone plans in their overall plan) and churned customers (9% without phone plans). By contrast, the proportion of customers without internet plans among active clients (27% no internet service) was higher than those that had churned (6% no internet service).\n",
    "- The Gradient Boosting model (Light GBM) performed the best with a final AUC-ROC Score of 0.831 for the validation data set and an accuracy score of 0.803. The best fit model was as follows: number rounds=100, GBDT boosting, binary objective, colsample_bytree=0.8, max_depth=3, num_leaves=31, subsample=0.8.\n",
    "- The Logistic Regression model was the most poorly performing of the three models, with a final AUC-ROC Score of 0.744 for validation data (below the minimum required score), and an accuracy score 0.753. This model had a low level of overfitting based on metrics for training vs. validation data. The best fit model for Logistic Regression used downsampled features (fraction=0.42), and a classification threshold (0.5).\n",
    "- The Random Forest Classification performed decently, with a validation data AUC-ROC Score of 0.757 just over the minimum required score of 0.75. The accuracy score for the final model on validation data was 0.717. There was some overfitting based. The final Random Forest Classification model (max_depth=6, n_estimators=20) was used with downsampled features (fraction=0.38) and a classification threshold (0.46).\n",
    "- The AUC-ROC scores were similar to the accuracy scores, with AUC-ROC slightly better for the Gradient Boosting model (difference of 0.028), and slightly worse for the Random Forest model (difference of 0.040). For the Gradient Boosting model, this suggests the model is stronger at assigning probabilities for the target classes, but not as accurate in predicting the actual class (churn vs. not). However, given the small difference, this is likely not a key concern. In addition. AUC-ROC is generally better for data with class imbalances, which the data for this project exhibits. \n",
    "- The final Gradient Boosting model performed with with the final test data, with an AUC-ROC score of 0.842 and an accuracy score of 0.808. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradient Boosting model (Light GBM, number rounds=100, GBDT boosting, binary objective, colsample_bytree=0.8, max_depth=3, num_leaves=31, subsample=0.8) is recommended to the company to use to identify customers that may leave, given the high AUC-ROC score (0.842 on test data) and similar accuracy score (0.808). \n"
