# TT_Sprint17_FinalProject
This is a repository for TT Sprint 17 Project forecasting customer churn for a telecom operator. In this project:

- Tested machine learning binary classification models, including logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting (Light GBM) to identify recommended model for predicting customer churn. 
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, used feature engineering to create new variables for analysis, tested models on training, validation and test data, and identified gradient boosting as the most effective model.
- The model was built and tested on the Jupyter platform using Python language coding.
- The model was developed and tested by the data science student, and reviewed by a project reviewer.

To run the program, Python 3 (3.11.5) was used with the following libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, lightgbm).
